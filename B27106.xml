         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IF the Weather-Glass of the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> be in that kind Ʋseful, the several <hi>Papers</hi> which frequently come forth, are no less service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Ʋnderstanding the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These appear under several <hi>Titles,</hi> as Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, Addresses, Petitions, Advices, Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, (not to mention the <hi>Pulpit-Harangues,</hi> whose Matter is often taken out of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, with the Form and Trimming <hi>peculiar</hi> to that sort of Speakers) To these may be added the <hi>Satyrs,</hi> which afford no less <hi>Instruction,</hi> tho' more of <hi>Diversion,</hi> by the Advantage of Verse and Song.</p>
                  <p>Among the Ancients, <hi>Satyr</hi> was in much esteem, being as a Faithful Looking-Glass of <hi>Humane Nature</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> wherein the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Ignorance, and Follies of all sort of Persons were fairly represented, which either Self-Love would not <hi>suffer</hi> them to <hi>see,</hi> or the Interest and Flattery of others might <hi>endeavour</hi> to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:199601:3"/>
                  <p>Of Later Times, the Small Remains of the <hi>Old Roman Spirit,</hi> tho' miserably opprest with the <hi>scandalous</hi> Load of Priestly Government, has taken the boldness to express its Resentment of the Enormities of those <hi>Infalllible Vicars,</hi> by the Persons of <hi>Pasquin</hi> and <hi>Marforio,</hi> who upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, do freely tax the Lewdness, Hypocrisie and Rapine of that Herd of Ecclesiasticks.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Neighbours</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> being a People somewhat <hi>Phlegmatick,</hi> are <hi>us'd</hi> to oppress their <hi>Satyr</hi> by their <hi>Pencils;</hi> but <hi>our</hi> Nation, being of a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Jolly</hi> Temper, has been of long time <hi>accustom'd</hi> to <hi>ridicule</hi> the Reigning Follies of <hi>Particulars,</hi> and the Ill Actions and Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of <hi>Publick</hi> Persons by <hi>Lampoon</hi> and <hi>Song.</hi> To say nothing of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who oft-times are not sparing in that way.</p>
                  <p>It has been thought fit, the Present Times having given much occasion to this sort of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to Collect the most Considerable <hi>Pieces</hi> which have been Publish'd of this Nature, and it were to be wish'd that the like were done in those Things which relate to <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> for this common Reason, lest being neglected for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Small,</hi> they should be lost, becoming the <hi>Prey</hi> of <hi>Time.</hi>

                     <head>The VISION.</head>
                     <lg>
                        <l>TWas at an hour when busie Nature lay</l>
                        <l>Dissolv'd in slumbers from the noisy Day,</l>
                        <l>When gloomy shades and dusky Atoms spread</l>
                        <l>A darkness o'er the Universal Bed,</l>
                        <l>And all the gaudy beams of light were fled;</l>
                        <l>My flutt'ring fancy 'midst the silent peace,</l>
                        <l>Careless of <hi>sleep,</hi> and unconcern'd with <hi>ease,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Drew to my wandring thoughts an object near,</l>
                        <l>Strange in its <hi>form,</hi> and in <hi>appearance</hi> rare.</l>
                        <l>Methought (yet sure it could not be a Dream,</l>
                        <l>So real all its Imperfections seem)</l>
                        <l>With <hi>Princely</hi> Port a stately <hi>Monarch</hi> came,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Airy</hi> his mein, and <hi>Noble</hi> was his frame:</l>
                        <l>A sullen sorrow brooded on his Brow;</l>
                        <l>He seem'd beneath some weighty Fate to bow;</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Distrust</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> upon his Eye-lids rest,</l>
                        <l>And show the strugling troubles of his Breast.</l>
                        <l>Upon his Head a <hi>nodding Crown</hi> he wore,</l>
                        <l>And in his Hand a <hi>yielding Scepter</hi> bore;</l>
                        <l>Forlorn and careless did his strokes appear,</l>
                        <l>And every motion spoke a wild <hi>Despair.</hi>

                        <l>This mournful Scene did all my Passions move,</l>
                        <l>And challeng'd both my <hi>pity</hi> and my <hi>love,</hi>

                        </l>
                        <l>Long did he in a pensive silence stand,</l>

                     <l>How to Rule Kings, and how to Govern States.</l>
                     <l>Most strange Employments sure for Gospel Preachers,</l>

                        <l>Of mighty <hi>Perseus, Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Theseus;</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>And several other gallant Heroes too,</l>

                        <l>
                           <hi>Nemean</hi> Lion bold <hi>Hercules</hi> did choak,</l>
                        <l>And of his Skin made him a lasting Cloak.</l>
                        <l>The far-fam'd <hi>Perseus</hi> kill'd a mighty Whale,</l>
                        <l>And all t' enjoy <hi>Andromeda</hi>'s brown Tail.</l>
                        <l>Historians all the great St. <hi>George</hi> admire,</l>

                     </head>
                     <l>STand forth thou grand Impostor of our time,</l>
                     <l>The Nations scandal, Punishment and Crime;</l>
                     <l>Unjust Usurper of ill gotten Praise,</l>
                     <l>Unmatch'd by all but thy leud <hi>Brother Bays;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>How well have you your sev'ral Gallants chose,</l>
                     <l>Damnably to plague the World in Verse and Prose.</l>
                     <l>Like two <hi>Twin Comets:</hi> when you do appear</l>
                     <l>We justly may suspect some danger near.</l>
                     <l>He lately did under correction pass,</l>
                     <l>Honour'd by that great hand that gave the Lash,</l>
                     <l>A doom too glorious for that cursed head,</l>
                     <l>And unproportion'd to the Life he lead,</l>
                     <l>But you are to a viler fate design'd,</l>
                     <l>To suffer by a vulgar hand like mine,</l>
                     <l>We'll tear your Vizard and unmask your shame,</l>
                     <l>And at each corner Gibbet up your name.</l>
                     <l>Expose you to the Scorn of all you meet,</l>
                     <l>As Dogs drag grinning Cats about the Street.</l>
                     <l>Under Usurping <hi>Noll</hi> you first began</l>
                     <l>To rear your Head and shew your self a Man;</l>
                     <l>Unpittying saw the Royal Party fall,</l>
                     <l>And Danc'd and Fiddled to the Funeral;</l>
                     <l>Disclaim'd their Interest and renounc'd their side,</l>
                     <l>And with the Independant straight comply'd;</l>

                     <l>Officious in their Service wrote for Hire;</l>
                     <l>A brisk Crowdero in the Factious Quire:</l>
                     <l>Your nimble Pen on all their Errands run;</l>
                     <l>The Horoscope still opens to the Sun.</l>
                     <l>There 'twas in those unhappy days,</l>
                     <l>You laid foundation for designed Praise;</l>
                     <l>By disrespect ignobly purchas'd shame,</l>
                     <l>And damn'd your Soul to scandalize your Name:</l>
                     <l>When <hi>Charles</hi> at length by Providence came in,</l>
                     <l>You fac'd about and quickly chang'd the Scene;</l>
                     <l>Turn'd to new Notes your mercenary strings,</l>
                     <l>Began to play Divinity of Kings:</l>
                     <l>Your former Master straightway is forgot,</l>
                     <l>Stil'd Villain, Rogue, Thief Murderer, what not?</l>
                     <l>Such recompence he doth deserve to have,</l>
                     <l>Who for his Interest durst employ a Knave.</l>
                     <l>Now 'twas a time you thought to take your ease,</l>
                     <l>After such great Exploits perform'd as these:</l>
                     <l>Applauding to your self your own deserts,</l>
                     <l>You strait set up for a vain Ass of Parts;</l>
                     <l>Resolving that the Ladies too should know,</l>
                     <l>What other Tricks and Gambals you could do.</l>
                     <l>Was there a skipping Whore about the Town?</l>
                     <l>Or private Baudy-house to you unknown?</l>
                     <l>Here for a Stallion, there for a Pimp you went;</l>
                     <l>To do both Drudgeries alike content.</l>
                     <l>But Ill success you had with Madam <hi>C—k,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Whom in the Act her Husband took:</l>
                     <l>Strong <hi>Bastinado</hi> o're your shoulders laid,</l>
                     <l>Made you a while surcease that letcherous trade,</l>
                     <l>Till growing old in customary sin,</l>
                     <l>You with a Chaster Lady did begin.</l>
                     <l>Whom when you found she all Assaults refus'd,</l>
                     <l>And would not yield her self to be abus'd;</l>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:199601:121"/>
                     <l>Down on your Knees you presently was laid,</l>
                     <l>And thus (O righteous Heaven) devoutly pray'd;</l>
                     <l>Since you disdain the kind request to grant,</l>
                     <l>Dear Madam let me lay my hand upon't.</l>
                     <l>This is the Man whose whole Discourse and tone,</l>
                     <l>Is Honour, Justice, Truth, Religion;</l>
                     <l>Was such a Godly Rascal ever known?</l>
                     <l>But now reform'd by indigence of Gold.</l>
                     <l>Your former wanton course grew slack and cold,</l>
                     <l>For 'twas at first indeed too hot to hold.</l>
                     <l>Now new expedients must employ your Brain,</l>
                     <l>And other Methods for advance of Gain;</l>
                     <l>Something contriv'd in private, touch'd the State,</l>
                     <l>Which made you timely think of a retreat;</l>
                     <l>Beyond Sea then the wretched Caitiff flies,</l>
                     <l>A guilty Conscience has Quick-sighted Eyes.</l>
                     <l>When you return'd, you fell to work amain,</l>
                     <l>And took up your old Scribling trade again;</l>
                     <l>Some sorry scandal on Fanaticks thrown,</l>
                     <l>And viler Canting upon Forty one;</l>
                     <l>You thought sufficient to oblige the Crown;</l>
                     <l>Then who but you, the World was all your own.</l>
                     <l>Now for the Church of <hi>England</hi> you declare,</l>
                     <l>A witty zealous Protestant appear;</l>

                     <l>To pay for false Intelligence and News:</l>
                     <l>When nam'd in two Diurnals you dispence</l>
                     <l>Equally void of Reason, Truth, and Sense.</l>
                     <l>Guinea's now from every quarter came</l>
                     <l>To pay respect to your encreasing Fame,</l>
                     <l>While you at <hi>Sam</hi>'s like a grave Doctor sate,</l>
                     <l>Teaching the Minor Clergy how to prate,</l>
                     <l>Who lickt your Spittle up and then came down,</l>
                     <l>And shed the nasty Drivel o're the Town.</l>

                     <l>Ay these were blessed times and happy days,</l>
                     <l>When all the World conspired to your praise:</l>
                     <l>He who refus'd and would no Token send,</l>
                     <l>Must be traduc'd as the Dissenters Friend:</l>
                     <l>And that your Greatness no regard might lack,</l>
                     <l>You got a Knighthood chopt upon your Back.</l>
                     <l>But something now has stopt that rapid stream,</l>
                     <l>And you have nothing more to say for them:</l>
                     <l>Your piercing Eye discovers from a far,</l>
                     <l>The glittering Glory of some further Star,</l>
                     <l>Which bids you pay your adoration there.</l>
                     <l>Inconstant Rover, whether do'st thou tend?</l>
                     <l>When will thy tedious Villanies have end?</l>
                     <l>Whither at last do'st thou intend to go?</l>
                     <l>Of which party wilt thou e'er prove true?</l>
                     <l>To Turk, or Pope, to Protestant or Jew?</l>
                     <l>Should I here all thy Villanies recount,</l>
                     <l>To what a mighty summ do they amount?</l>
                     <l>Thy solemn Protestations, Oaths and Lies,</l>
                     <l>Devices, Shams, Evasions, Perjuries,</l>
                     <l>My Paper to a Volumn would exceed,</l>
                     <l>Of greater bulk than <hi>Hollingshead</hi> and <hi>Speed.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>For thou art now so scandalously known,</l>
                     <l>And so remarkable in Vice alone,</l>
                     <l>That every one can find a stone to throw</l>
                     <l>At such a snarling pimping Cur as thou.</l>
                     <l>But wretch! if still thou art not past all Grace,</l>
                     <l>And wholsome counsel can with thee find place;</l>
                     <l>If thou at last sincerely wouldst attone,</l>
                     <l>And expiate thy former mischiefs done,</l>
                     <l>Like dying <hi>Judas</hi> render back thy pelf,</l>
